      <p>Welcome to the Straight client example. Loading this page from the filesystem won't work since ajax-requests cannot be sent to other domains.</p>
      
      <p>Clicking the button below will generate a new address for the order for 1 Satoshi and will subscribe you to the websocket, which will automatically notify you when the money arrive to the address. You don't have to refresh this page.</p>

      <p>Use this form to generate a new order:</p>
      Gateway id: <input name="gateway_id"/>
      <p><button id="create_order">Create Order</button></p>
